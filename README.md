# Incidence-Matrix
* This is a project for the subject of Discrete Mathematics
* Which consists of a program based on an incidence matrix (matrix that represents the edges and which nodes connect in a graph) entered by the user, generates an adjacency matrix (that represents the connections between the nodes of the graph) and also gives us the option of generating paths and circuits with the nodes and edges of the graph.
* Codified in C++, using standard input
